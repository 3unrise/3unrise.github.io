#### Introduction

When working with STM32 microcontrollers, you might develop projects in STM32CubeIDE but later need to migrate them to Keil (MDK-ARM) for advanced debugging, performance optimization, or better integration with CMSIS and RTOS. In this guide, Iâ€™ll walk you through the step-by-step process of creating an STM32CubeIDE project in Keil for the NUCLEO-F446RE board.
